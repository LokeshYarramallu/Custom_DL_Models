<b>PROJECT DESCRIPTION</b><br>
Welcome to the **Custom DL Models** open-source repository, where you can unleash your creativity in deep learning! üöÄ We support a variety of neural network architectures, including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), Deep Neural Networks (DNN), Transformers, and innovative combinational networks. Users can upload their custom models, pretrained models with custom datasets, and dive into the world of hyperparameter tuning. Whether you're a PyTorch enthusiast or a TensorFlow devotee, we've got you covered! üí°

## Project Overview üåü

[Provide a brief overview of the project. Explain its purpose and how it can be beneficial to the deep learning community.]

## Folder Structure üìÇ

The repository follows a specific structure to organize the custom models and their associated resources. The main project is stored in a folder named after the project name, and within that folder, you can find the following:

- **README.md**: This file provides detailed information about the project, its content, and the methods applied for hyperparameter tuning.

- **Source Code**: All code related to the project is stored in a dedicated directory.

- **Datasets**: The datasets used for training and testing the custom models are included here.

- **Images**: üì∑ This folder contains images and diagrams illustrating the custom networks used.

- **Training and Testing**: Code and scripts for training and testing the models can be found here.

[Explain any additional directories and their purposes.]

## Getting Started üöÄ

[Provide instructions for users on how to get started with your repository. Include information on prerequisites, installation steps, and any dependencies that need to be addressed. Example code for setting up a virtual environment, if applicable, could be provided.]

## Custom Networks üß¨

[Explain the different types of custom networks that can be found in this repository, including CNNs, RNNs, DNNs, Transformers, and combinational networks. Describe their architectures and use cases.]

## Hyperparameter Tuning ‚öôÔ∏è

The repository encourages users to experiment with hyperparameters to optimize their custom models. Here's a list of key hyperparameters that can be tuned:

- **Initialization**: Choose your weapon for weight initialization. üí™

- **Dropout**: Embrace dropout layers for model robustness. üõ°Ô∏è

- **Data Augmentation**: Augment your data for greater generalization. üìà

- **Early Stopping**: Know when to call it quits with early stopping. ‚è±Ô∏è

- **Ensemble Methods**: Join forces for even better predictions. ü§ù

[Include code examples and guidelines for hyperparameter tuning.]
